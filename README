Mr. Jones has graciously put his code in the public domain, as do I:
PUBLIC DOMAIN -----------------------------------------------------------------
I, the copyright holder of this work, hereby release it into the public domain.
This applies worldwide. In case this is not legally possible, I grant any 
entity the right to use this work for any purpose, without any conditions,
unless such conditions are required by law.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Requirements:
  * computer with an i386 or better 32-bit microprocessor
	* Linux kernel 2.4,2.6, or 3.x (I prefer the Debian distribution & userland)
	* A shell
	* flat assembler (fasm) (flatassembler.net)
	* some understanding of intel x86 assembler and forth

Extras:
	* a text editor (I prefer vim)
	* a C compiler capable of producing elf shared objects (gcc)

Building:
'fasm core.asm flow'
gcc -fpic -shared -o libhello.so hello.c

Examples:
There are two example forth source files: debug.4th and dyn.4th
'debug' has some debugging words, like SEE for viewing the source of
non-primitives, and DUMP for dumping memory contents.
'dyn' shows how to use the dynamic link-loading facilty, opening the
shared object 'libhello.so', linking the function 'hello', and finally
calling the function 'hello'. 'man dlopen' or use a search engine for
more information on dynamic-link loading under Linux.

Notes:
The include file 'unistd-26.inc' will work with version 3.x kernels.
The code is in a very chaotic state.
A lot of things are commented out; you may find them useful.
A half-hearted attempt at DPANS94 compatiblity was abandoned.

Happy Hacking!
